2d folder - contains files (and utility fxns) to read .wav audio files and their corresponding bathymetry's, train neural network, and do 2d reconstruction with output of net

input_output.m: reads .wav audio files and their corresponding bathymetry and creates input and output for neural net
nnet.m: contains neural network architecture and runs training algorithm
net1main.m: reconstructs bathymetry from output of neural net
